# VBAChallenge
Homework Week 2
## Overview of Project
### Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to easily analyze an entire dataset and learn how to refactor previous VBA code to deal with a new senerio. In this senerio we are using VBA to look at a dozon stocks and determine the total volume and return percentage for each Stock. 

## Results
I started this code with the code 'challenge_starter_code.vbs' given by the module and the 'green_stocks.xlsm' I used as going through the module. 
### Step 1:
#### Step 1a: 

In this step I created the 'tickerIndex' variable (as a single) and initalized it at 0.
  '1a) Create a ticker Index
  Dim tickerIndex As Single
  tickerIndex = 0'

#### Step 1b:
In this step I created the three arrays: tickerVolumes (as long), tickerStartingPrices (as single), and tickerEndingPrices (as single).
    '1b) Create three output arrays
    Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
Doing these two steps
